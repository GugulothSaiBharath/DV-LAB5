#iris dataset scatter plot matrix

This will generate a scatter plot matrix for the iris dataset,
showing the relationships between each pair of variables (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) in the dataset. 
The diagonal of the plot matrix shows the distribution of each variable.

#iris dataset linearly separable class

The accuracy of the model on the test set will give us an indication of how well the data is separable. 
If the accuracy is high, it means that the classes are well separated by a linear boundary and the linear SVM model can easily classify the data.
When we run the above code, we get an accuracy of 1.0, which indicates that the classes are perfectly linearly separable.

#adult dataset

we first load the adult dataset and check the first few rows and summary statistics of numerical variables.
We then create several explanatory graphics to present our exploratory findings:
The first graph is a count plot of income, which shows the distribution of the target variable in the dataset.
The second graph is a count plot of education, which shows the distribution of education levels in the dataset.
The third graph is a box plot of age by income, which shows the distribution of age for each income category.
The fourth graph is a boxen plot of education by income, which shows the relationship between education level and income.
The fifth graph is a bar plot of occupation by income, which shows the relationship between occupation and income.
These graphs can help us gain insights into the distribution of variables and their relationship with income, which is the target variable in the dataset.
